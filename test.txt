1. Define Roles

Create two roles in the application:
    o Admin: Responsible for managing user applications.
    o User: Can register and access their dashboard once approved.

2. User Application Registration

Implement a registration form with the following fields:
o Name
o Gender
o Date of Birth (DOB)
o Mobile Number
o Email Address
o Photo
Ensure that the Email Address and Mobile Number are unique and cannot be reused for
registration. After successful registration, send a confirmation email to the user using
Laravel Jobs.

3. Admin Panel

The Admin login panel should include the following menus:
o Dashboard: Displays a summary of application counts:
 Pending Applications
 Approved Applications
 Rejected Applications
o Pending Applications: Lists all newly registered applications. Admin can view
each application and take the following actions:
 Approve Application: Sends an approval email to the user with their
username and password for login.
 Reject Application: Sends a rejection email to the user with the reason for
rejection.
o Approved Applications: Lists all approved applications.
o Rejected Applications: Lists all rejected applications.
4. User Dashboard
Users can log in using the credentials sent in the approval email. Once logged in, the user
can view their My Profile page.

Additional Notes
     Use the latest Laravel version (Laravel 11).
     Implement email functionality using the Jobs feature.
     Create necessary database tables using Migrations.
     Use Seeders to pre-populate the database with Admin credentials.
     Implement Middleware to restrict access based on ro
